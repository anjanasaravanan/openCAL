What is CAL?
############

Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) is a novel method of three dimensional additive manufacturing (AM) which uses computerized tomography scans to volumetrically print objects from photo-curable resin. Traditional AM methods, such as fused deposition modeling or stereolithography, build 3D structures layer-by-layer, which imposes dimensional and surface-finish limitations, e.g. in the case of smoothly curving geometries. CAL, on the other hand, projects a series of 2D images onto a rotating, cylindrical vial filled with a photo-polymer.

CAL was developed by a collaboration between UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Applications
############
CAL has great potential to be used for bioprinting due to its speed and material versatility. One of the materials we use is GelMA, or gelatin methacrylate, mixed with a photoinitiator; this is a biocompatible hydrogel with fast printing times and highly tunable material properties.

Why open-source?
################
OpenCAL is intended to serve volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) enthusiasts and institutions alike. We hope that our design will be used as a template which can be tweaked to meet the needs of different users and their experimental aims.
