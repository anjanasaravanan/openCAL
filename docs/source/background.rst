What is CAL?
############

Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) is a novel method of three dimensional additive manufacturing (AM) which uses computerized tomography scans to volumetrically print objects from photo-curable resin. Traditional AM methods, such as fused deposition modeling or stereolithography, build 3D structures layer-by-layer, which imposes dimensional and surface-finish limitations, e.g. smoothly curving geometries. CAL, on the other hand, projects a series of 2D images onto a rotating, cylindrical vial filled with a photo-polymer.

CAL was developed by a collaboration between UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
